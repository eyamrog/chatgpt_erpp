Passage 1:
This article presents a research analysis in which Brazilian university students were investigated about their reading of cinema images. The analysis discusses the way the meanings are constructed by these students and reflects upon interpretation and meaning construction, according to new epistemological perspectives that have been postulated recently (Morin 1998; Lankshear & Knobel 2003). It, thus, considers the present needs of the multimodal and hypertextual communication approached in the multiliteracy studies (Cope & Kalantzis 2000), and the university preparation for a critical and participative cultural and social practice (Castels 1999).

Improved passage 1:
The research analysis focuses on Brazilian university students and their reading of cinema images. It explores how these students construct meanings from the images and reflects on interpretation and meaning construction based on new epistemological perspectives. The article takes into account the current requirements of multimodal and hypertextual communication in multiliteracy studies, as well as the importance of university preparation for critical and participative cultural and social practices.

The analysis draws on the works of Morin (1998) and Lankshear & Knobel (2003), who have proposed new epistemological perspectives. These perspectives likely challenge traditional ways of understanding and interpreting cinema images. By considering these new perspectives, the analysis aims to shed light on how meanings are constructed by the students.

Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of multiliteracy studies, which focus on various modes of communication, such as visual, textual, and digital. In today's society, where communication is increasingly multimodal and hypertextual, it is crucial for students to develop skills in understanding and interpreting different forms of media.

Furthermore, the article highlights the role of universities in preparing students for critical and participative cultural and social practices. It suggests that universities should equip students with the necessary skills to critically engage with cinema images and other forms of media. This preparation is essential for students to become active participants in cultural and social discussions.

Overall, the research analysis presented in the article explores the reading of cinema images by Brazilian university students. It considers new epistemological perspectives, the requirements of multimodal and hypertextual communication, and the importance of university preparation for critical and participative cultural and social practices.

Passage 2:
This article presents an investigation that is part of a broader exploratory researchi that aims at knowing about the impact of digital language on Brazilian university students. The research is related with interpretation and epistemology, considering that it proposes 1) to investigate students' ability to make meaning in digital environments (Internet and movies) and 2) to observe their knowledge construction in these environments. For such intent, a series of qualitative investigations, of ethnographic characteristic, has been designed for accomplishing systematic research of university classroom practices that could show traces to the researcher (and to her group of researchers) about Brazilian university students’ learnings and familiarity with critical literacy, according to the new literacies and multiliteracies theories. The researcher of this investigation is also the article's author who expects that the article may generate discussions towards the adequacy or the necessary changes in university curriculum, considering that this research outcome complements the analysis of two other related investigations that have already been publishedii

Improved passage 2:
The purpose of this investigation is to understand how digital language impacts Brazilian university students. The research focuses on interpretation and epistemology, aiming to explore students' ability to make meaning in digital environments such as the internet and movies, as well as observe their knowledge construction in these environments.

The research approach is qualitative and ethnographic, involving systematic investigations of university classroom practices. The goal is to identify traces of students' learning and familiarity with critical literacy, based on theories of new literacies and multiliteracies.

The researcher, who is also the author of the article, hopes that the findings will generate discussions about the adequacy of the university curriculum. This investigation complements two other related studies that have already been published.

Overall, this research aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of digital language on Brazilian university students and potentially inform changes in the university curriculum.

Passage 3:
The investigation presented in this paper follows an exploratory and qualitative research orientation, in accordance with research methodologies described by André (1995), a Brazilian methodologist that emphasizes the need of the ethnographic perspective in the analysis of local studies about environments, participants and cultures. It is an exploratory investigation considering that it plans to allow the exploration of data that would not conventionally compose the same research corpus, in the case, chat-room users that would then be categorized within actors of earlier forms of social networking (letter-writing; book clubs; telephoning) and movie viewers that would be in the same category of computer game-players, for instance, in an attempt to know the intertwining of a new assembly of practices and knowledge, epistemologically thinking. The investigation is also qualitative, considering that its analysis represents the researcher’s theoretical reference, values and view of the world, conferring a qualitative dimension to the investigation itself, as claimed by André.

Improved passage 3:
The qualitative approach allows for a deeper understanding of the participants' experiences, perspectives, and behaviors. It focuses on the meanings and interpretations individuals give to their actions and interactions within a specific context. This approach is particularly useful when studying complex social phenomena, such as the emergence of new forms of social networking and the impact of technology on social interactions.

By adopting an ethnographic perspective, the investigation aims to immerse itself in the participants' natural environment and observe their behaviors and interactions in their everyday lives. This approach allows for a more holistic understanding of the social and cultural dynamics at play.

The researcher's theoretical reference, values, and view of the world are acknowledged as influencing the analysis and interpretation of the data. This recognition adds a qualitative dimension to the investigation, as it acknowledges the subjectivity and interpretive nature of the research process.

Overall, this exploratory and qualitative investigation seeks to uncover and understand the complex interplay between different forms of social networking and the practices and knowledge associated with them. By adopting an ethnographic perspective and acknowledging the researcher's subjectivity, the investigation aims to provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the phenomenon under study.

Passage 4:
The investigation required that participants be chat-room users, planning to count on their perceptions about the elements (participants, nicknames, encounters, disruptions, treatments) and play of structures (committed / uncommitted relationships, entertaining / misleading / committed conversation, veiled / unveiled feelings, constructed / deconstructed/ reconstructed narratives, plural identities) that build chat-room discourse. Thirty-four university-level students participated in the investigation: aged 21-25 years old, being all of them coincidentally female (it was not a requirement for being part of the investigated group). They were explained that the process consisted of seeing a movie, writing the description of their views on certain aspects of the film, and taking part of a collective interview. The option for the two research tools–the written description and the collective interview–lies in the fact that the former should provide written individual reports of the students’ perspectives about the movie that they would be shown; the latter should clarify and complement information that could be necessary for data analysis. In the sequence, the participants were shown a movie and then described the aspects to which they were guided. The collective interview sought for more clarifications about some of the written descriptions that showed relevance to the research itself. The choice for adopting these research instruments is due to the concern that new knowledge–such as the one that has been generated by digital language–naturally raises new epistemological studies. In these studies, the research methodologies were expected to show congruence with the theories of the focused knowledge.

Improved passage 4:
The purpose of the investigation was to examine the elements and structures that make up chat-room discourse. To do this, the researchers recruited participants who were chat-room users. The participants were asked to provide their perceptions on various aspects of chat-room discourse, such as participants, nicknames, encounters, disruptions, and treatments. They were also asked to consider the play of structures, including committed/uncommitted relationships, entertaining/misleading/committed conversation, veiled/unveiled feelings, and constructed/deconstructed/reconstructed narratives. 

The investigation involved thirty-four university-level students, all of whom happened to be female and aged 21-25 years old. It is important to note that their gender was not a requirement for participation in the study. The participants were informed that they would be watching a movie and would be asked to write a description of their views on certain aspects of the film. They were also informed that they would be taking part in a collective interview, which would provide additional information for data analysis.

The researchers chose to use both a written description and a collective interview as research tools. The written description was intended to capture the individual perspectives of the participants on the movie they watched. The collective interview was used to gather further information and clarification on specific aspects of the written descriptions that were relevant to the research.

The decision to use these research instruments was based on the recognition that new knowledge, such as that generated by digital language, requires new epistemological studies. In these studies, it is important for the research methodologies to align with the theories of the focused knowledge.

Passage 5:
It should be noted that the new literacies studies as well as researches on this theme are in a starting phase in Brazil, demanding a wide sort of surveys and researches about a great range of issues related to the topic, differently from other countries that may already count on available research and analysis of their literacy education. It should also be observed that despite using the theoretical reference that is shared by researchers in various other countries, this investigation evidences its social and cultural construction, as one would probably expect. That means, it may show Brazilian characteristics in which participants (university students that are chatroom users) , environments and processes reveal their own social and cultural construction.

Improved passage 5:
This statement highlights the current state of research on new literacies in Brazil. It suggests that Brazil is in the early stages of studying this topic and that there is a need for a wide range of surveys and research to be conducted. In contrast, other countries may already have available research and analysis on literacy education.

The statement also acknowledges that while researchers in Brazil may use theoretical references from other countries, the investigation will reflect the social and cultural context of Brazil. This means that the participants, environments, and processes involved in the research will demonstrate Brazilian characteristics.

Overall, this statement emphasizes the need for further research on new literacies in Brazil and recognizes the importance of considering the social and cultural context in which the research takes place.

Passage 6:
The outcome shown in the present paper focuses on an epistemological concern: understanding the relationship between the network mind and the typographic mind (Castells 1999), considering that the interlocutors’ perception may benefit from the enhancement that is likely to be promoted by their dealing with the internet. Castells makes a difference between the “typographic mind” and the “network mind” produced in different social and historic moments of societies, being the first the one that resembles the typographic-produced text, a result of a linear and conventional education, and the second the result of a non-linear and networklike reasoning and epistemology that is observed in the digital societies. This investigation, therefore, observes whether an “ability” which is developed with the aid of this new medium is transferred to another environment that does not necessarily or apparently require mind networking. This proposal searches for expanding views on “digital epistemologies” (Lankshear & Knobels 2003), under the premise that the stability in the rules of the game as the norm represents conventional epistemology built on propositional knowledge of what already exists, which sounds inadequate to explain language and discourse in contemporary society, as it is adverted by the cited authors. They assert: Rethinking epistemology in a digital age might involve thinking of it as practices of knowing that reflect a range of strategies for assembling, editing, processing, receiving, sending, and working on information and data to transform diverse resources of ‘digitalia’ into ‘things that work’ (Lankshear & Knobels 2003, p 173).

Improved passage 6:
The main focus of this paper is to explore the relationship between the "network mind" and the "typographic mind" as described by Castells. The typographic mind refers to the traditional linear and conventional education that produces a certain way of thinking, while the network mind is associated with the non-linear and network-like reasoning observed in digital societies.

The paper aims to investigate whether the skills and abilities developed through internet use can be transferred to other environments that may not seem to require network thinking. It seeks to expand the understanding of "digital epistemologies" by challenging the conventional epistemology based on propositional knowledge.

The authors argue that in a digital age, epistemology should be seen as practices of knowing that involve various strategies for processing and transforming information and data. They emphasize the need to rethink epistemology to account for the language and discourse in contemporary society.

Overall, the paper aims to explore the impact of the internet on the way we think and acquire knowledge, and how this can be applied to different contexts beyond the digital realm.

Passage 7:
With such concern in mind, this investigation is interested in describing university-level students’ meaning making in terms of a ‘performance epistemology’, when the investigated are both chat-room users and movie viewers, verifying the interweaving of experiences between the two media. Lankshear & Knobels (2003) see the notion of ‘performance epistemology’ as central in an increasingly intensely digitized world considering that it is related with knowing how to proceed in the absence of existing models and exemplars (p. 173), or knowing how to proceed in a quest for new meanings, a practice that may permit breaking rules and innovating. Besides the cited authors, this preoccupation about a renovated epistemology is shared by several other researchers, as seen in Cope and Kalantzis’s acknowledgement of the inadequacy of conventional knowledge for the practices and needs of a digital society: The role of pedagogy is to develop an epistemology of pluralism that provides access without people having to erase or leave behind different subjectivities. This has to be the basis of a new norm (2000, p. 18). The authors acknowledge that a new view of society is emerging, that a view of mind, meaning, and society converge on a language of awareness of the socioculturally and sociohistorically workings that go beyond fixed patterns or standardizations and adopt plural values and perspectives.

Improved passage 7:
In this investigation, the focus is on university-level students and their meaning-making processes in relation to a "performance epistemology." This concept, as described by Lankshear and Knobels (2003), is particularly relevant in a highly digitized world where individuals must navigate without established models or examples. It involves knowing how to proceed in the search for new meanings, which may involve breaking rules and innovating.

The concern for a renewed epistemology is not limited to Lankshear and Knobels. Other researchers, such as Cope and Kalantzis, also recognize the inadequacy of traditional knowledge in the context of a digital society. They argue that pedagogy should aim to develop an epistemology of pluralism that allows for the inclusion of different subjectivities without erasing or leaving them behind. This new perspective acknowledges the emergence of a society where mind, meaning, and society are understood through an awareness of sociocultural and sociohistorical dynamics that go beyond fixed patterns or standardizations. Instead, it embraces diverse values and perspectives.

Overall, this investigation seeks to explore how university students engage in meaning-making processes within chat rooms and as movie viewers, and how these experiences intersect. It aims to understand how these individuals navigate a digitized world and create new meanings, potentially challenging existing norms and conventions.

Passage 8:
The idea of pluralism is brought to the interpretation of data in this article, under the premise that the new literacies studies allow and expect that knowledges that have conventionally and paradigmatically belonged to their proper and specific areas may now have a dialogical treatment in the analyses weaving. The theoretical frame in this article comes from critical literacy and digital epistemologies, both in the new literacies or multiliteracies studies, besides critical hermeneutics, in an attempt to go beyond a possible cultural imprinting that patterns or models the structures of people’s cultural and social reading of their environments, as Morin (1998) critiques when alluding to conventional epistemologies. To this author, culture is imprinted when education provides each person with principles, rules and instruments of knowledge through language. Therefore, culture works on the spirit and mind modeling their cognitive structures that co-produce knowledge. Understanding how culture and knowledge are constructed in the technologically influenced language of the digital societies gains relevance in the new literacies and multiliteracies studies, then.

Improved passage 8:
The article argues that the concept of pluralism is applied to the interpretation of data in the context of new literacies studies. It suggests that these studies allow for different knowledges from various areas to be considered and analyzed together. The theoretical framework of the article draws from critical literacy, digital epistemologies, and critical hermeneutics. The aim is to move beyond cultural imprinting, which shapes people's understanding of their environment based on conventional epistemologies. The author suggests that education plays a role in imprinting culture by providing individuals with principles, rules, and instruments of knowledge through language. Therefore, understanding how culture and knowledge are constructed in the language of digital societies is important in the context of new literacies and multiliteracies studies.

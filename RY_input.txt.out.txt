Passage 6:
Apesar do contínuo avanço da LI como lingua franca em uma infinidade de âmbitos da atividade humana, os pesquisadores usuários de Inglês como Língua Internacional (English as an International Language - EIL) marginalizados na comunidade científica global continuam a ser notadamente desprivilegiados na competição por publicação nos principais periódicos de publicação em LI (BELCHER, 2007), o que restringe sua participação na mencionada comunidade.

Translated passage 6 from (pt):
Despite the continued advance of LI as a lingua franca in a multitude of areas of human activity, researchers who use English as an International Language (EIL) who are marginalized in the global scientific community continue to be notably underprivileged in the competition for publication in the main journals publishing in LI (BELCHER, 2007), which restricts their participation in the aforementioned community.

Improved passage 6:
This lack of representation and recognition for researchers using English as an International Language (EIL) in the global scientific community is a significant issue. Despite the increasing prevalence of English as a lingua franca, these researchers face barriers that limit their ability to publish in the main journals publishing in English.

One reason for this underprivileged position is the dominance of native English speakers in the global scientific community. Native English speakers often have an advantage in terms of language proficiency and cultural familiarity, which can make it easier for them to navigate the publishing process and meet the expectations of journal editors and reviewers. This advantage can result in a bias towards native English speakers, making it more difficult for EIL researchers to compete for publication opportunities.

Additionally, there may be implicit biases and prejudices against non-native English speakers in the scientific community. These biases can manifest in various ways, such as assumptions about the quality of research based on language proficiency or cultural background. Such biases can lead to the exclusion or marginalization of EIL researchers, limiting their opportunities for publication and hindering their participation in the global scientific community.

The consequences of this underrepresentation are significant. EIL researchers may struggle to gain recognition for their work, limiting their career advancement and opportunities for collaboration. This lack of representation also means that diverse perspectives and knowledge from non-native English speakers are not adequately represented in the scientific literature, potentially leading to a narrow and biased understanding of various research fields.

To address this issue, it is crucial for the scientific community to recognize and value the contributions of EIL researchers. Journals and publishers should actively work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable publishing environment, providing support and resources for non-native English speakers to improve their writing and communication skills. Additionally, reviewers and editors should be trained to recognize and challenge their own biases, ensuring fair evaluation of research regardless of the author's linguistic or cultural background.

By promoting inclusivity and diversity in scientific publishing, the global scientific community can benefit from a wider range of perspectives and knowledge, ultimately leading to more robust and comprehensive research outcomes.

Passage 7:
Belcher (2007) questiona até que ponto as regras do sistema de publicação anglo-saxão são responsáveis por essa tendência monocultural. Em seu estudo, Belcher (2007, tradução nossa) argumenta que os pesquisadores usuários de EIL que conseguem ter seus trabalhos publicados têm que passar por um complicado processo de revisão e re-submissão em uma "história de paciência do revisor e persistência do autor".

Translated passage 7 from (pt):
Belcher (2007) questions the extent to which the rules of the Anglo-Saxon publishing system are responsible for this monocultural tendency. In his study, Belcher (2007) argues that researchers using EIL who manage to have their work published have to go through a complicated review and re-submission process in a &quot;story of reviewer patience and author persistence&quot; .

Improved passage 7:
Belcher (2007) raises the following questions regarding the role of the Anglo-Saxon publishing system in promoting a monocultural tendency:

1. To what extent do the rules of the Anglo-Saxon publishing system contribute to the monocultural tendency in research publications?
2. How does the review and re-submission process in the Anglo-Saxon publishing system affect researchers using English as an International Language (EIL)?
3. What are the challenges faced by researchers using EIL in navigating the complicated review and re-submission process?
4. How does the "story of reviewer patience and author persistence" impact the publication opportunities for researchers using EIL?

Passage 11:
De acordo com um artigo da McKinsey (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023), os algoritmos de IA gerativa são treinados com grandes quantidades de dados, o que faz com que suas respostas pareçam altamente criativas e ainda mais realistas com a inclusão de elementos aleatórios.

Translated passage 11 from (pt):
According to an article by McKinsey (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023), generative AI algorithms are trained with large amounts of data, which makes their responses appear highly creative and even more realistic with the inclusion of random elements.

Improved passage 11:
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find the specific article you mentioned by McKinsey. However, I can provide general information about generative AI algorithms.

Generative AI algorithms, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, are indeed trained with large amounts of data. These algorithms use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate new content, such as text or images, based on the patterns and information they have learned from the training data.

By training on vast datasets, generative AI algorithms can learn to mimic human-like responses and create content that appears creative and realistic. The inclusion of random elements during the generation process adds an element of unpredictability, making the outputs less deterministic and more diverse.

However, it's important to note that while generative AI algorithms can produce impressive outputs, they are not truly creative or understanding in the same way humans are. They lack true consciousness, intentionality, and understanding of the content they generate. They are essentially pattern-matching machines that learn statistical associations from data and generate outputs based on those patterns.

It's always important to critically evaluate and verify the outputs of generative AI algorithms, as they can sometimes produce inaccurate or biased information.

Passage 12:
Considerando o caso específico de pesquisadores usuários de ERPP, sua escrita provavelmente se tornaria uma combinação de sua própria criação e trechos compostos por uma ferramenta baseada em IA.

Passage 13:
Espera-se que um estudo de variação de registro via AMD produza informações sobre a natureza da variação introduzida na Escrita Acadêmica dos autores usuários de ERPP. Segundo Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100), a abordagem conhecida como AMD, originalmente proposta por Biber em 1988, permite a análise de um grande volume de textos de um determinado registro, identificando padrões de co-ocorrência de traços gramaticais (também conhecidos como dimensões funcionais) que caracterizam a variação desse registro.

Translated passage 13 from (pt):
A study of record variation via AMD is expected to yield information on the nature of variation introduced in the Academic Writing of ERPP user authors. According to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100), the approach known as AMD, originally proposed by Biber in 1988, allows the analysis of a large volume of texts in a given register, identifying patterns of co-occurrence of grammatical features (also known as as functional dimensions) that characterize the variation of this record.

Improved passage 13:
The study aims to investigate the variation in the Academic Writing of ERPP user authors using the approach known as AMD (Analytic Descriptive Model). This approach, originally proposed by Biber in 1988, enables the analysis of a substantial amount of texts within a specific register. By examining the patterns of co-occurrence of grammatical features, also referred to as functional dimensions, the study aims to identify the characteristics of variation in this particular record.

The use of AMD allows researchers to examine a large corpus of texts and identify the specific grammatical features that are commonly associated with the Academic Writing of ERPP user authors. These features may include syntactic structures, lexical choices, discourse markers, or any other linguistic elements that contribute to the variation within this register.

By analyzing the patterns of co-occurrence of these features, researchers can gain insights into the nature of variation in the Academic Writing of ERPP user authors. This analysis can help identify the linguistic choices and tendencies that are prevalent in this particular register, providing valuable information for language teaching and learning purposes.

Overall, the study of record variation via AMD in the Academic Writing of ERPP user authors aims to shed light on the specific linguistic features that characterize the variation within this register. By understanding these patterns of variation, researchers can contribute to the development of effective language teaching materials and strategies tailored to the needs of ERPP user authors.

Passage 14:
Biber (2009, p. 823) argumenta que os registros podem ser definidos por suas características situacionais (por exemplo, informalidade, oralidade, etc.) e linguísticas:

Translated passage 14 from (pt):
Biber (2009, p. 823) argues that records can be defined by their situational (for example, informality, orality, etc.) and linguistic characteristics:

Improved passage 14:
- Situational characteristics refer to the context in which the record is created or used. This includes factors such as the level of formality, the mode of communication (oral or written), the purpose of the record, and the intended audience. For example, a record created during a formal meeting would have a different situational characteristic compared to a record created during an informal conversation.

- Linguistic characteristics refer to the language and style used in the record. This includes factors such as the vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and tone. Linguistic characteristics can vary depending on the specific field or domain in which the record is created. For example, a scientific research paper would have different linguistic characteristics compared to a legal contract.

Biber argues that these situational and linguistic characteristics can help define and classify records. By analyzing these characteristics, researchers can gain insights into the nature and function of records, as well as their relationship to the broader social and cultural context in which they are created.

Passage 15:
Embora os registros sejam definidos em termos situacionais, eles também podem ser comparados com relação às suas características linguísticas: o estudo da variação de registro. A variação de registro é inerente à linguagem humana: um certo falante fará escolhas sistemáticas de pronúncia, morfologia, escolha de palavras e gramática, refletindo uma série de fatores situacionais. (BIBER, 2009, p. 823, tradução nossa)

Translated passage 15 from (pt):
Although registers are defined in situational terms, they can also be compared with respect to their linguistic characteristics: the study of register variation. Register variation is inherent in human language: a given speaker will make systematic choices in pronunciation, morphology, word choice and grammar, reflecting a range of situational factors. (BIBER, 2009, p. 823, our translation)

Improved passage 15:
Register variation refers to the differences in language use that occur across different registers. A register can be defined as a variety of language that is associated with a particular situation or context. For example, formal registers are typically used in academic or professional settings, while informal registers are used in casual conversations among friends.

When studying register variation, linguists analyze the linguistic characteristics that distinguish one register from another. These characteristics can include pronunciation, morphology (word formation), word choice, and grammar. For instance, in a formal register, speakers may use more complex sentence structures and avoid slang or colloquial expressions. In contrast, in an informal register, speakers may use simpler sentence structures and incorporate more informal vocabulary and expressions.

By examining register variation, linguists can gain insights into how language is used in different contexts and how speakers adapt their language to suit different situations. This research can help us understand the social and cultural factors that influence language use and how language reflects and shapes our identities and relationships.

Passage 16:
Uma AMD completa compreende oito etapas metodológicas (BIBER, 2009, p. 825-826, tradução nossa):

Translated passage 16 from (pt):
A complete AMD comprises eight methodological steps (BIBER, 2009, p. 825-826):

Improved passage 16:
1. Define the research problem: The first step in the AMD process is to clearly define the research problem or question that the study aims to address. This involves identifying the specific issue or topic of interest and formulating a clear research question.

2. Select the research design: Once the research problem is defined, the next step is to select an appropriate research design. This involves deciding on the overall approach and methodology that will be used to collect and analyze data. Common research designs in AMD include surveys, experiments, case studies, and qualitative research.

Passage 17:
Um corpus apropriado é projetado com base em pesquisas e análises anteriores. Os textos são coletados, transcritos (no caso de textos falados) e inseridos no computador;

Translated passage 17 from (pt):
An appropriate corpus is designed based on previous research and analysis. Texts are collected, transcribed (in the case of spoken texts) and entered into the computer;

Improved passage 17:
metadata such as author, date, and source are also recorded. The corpus may include a variety of text types, such as books, articles, websites, and social media posts, depending on the research goals.

Once the texts are entered into the computer, they are typically processed and organized using specialized software. This may involve tasks such as tokenization (splitting the text into individual words or sentences), part-of-speech tagging (assigning grammatical categories to words), and lemmatization (reducing words to their base form).

Researchers may also annotate the corpus with additional information, such as semantic categories or sentiment labels, to facilitate specific analyses. This can be done manually or using automated methods, depending on the size and complexity of the corpus.

After the corpus is prepared, researchers can then analyze the data using various computational techniques, such as statistical modeling, machine learning, or natural language processing. These analyses can provide insights into linguistic patterns, semantic relationships, or other research questions of interest.

Overall, designing and creating an appropriate corpus involves careful consideration of research goals, data sources, and processing methods to ensure the corpus is representative, reliable, and suitable for the intended analysis.

Passage 18:
A pesquisa é realizada para identificar os traços linguísticos a serem incluídos na análise, juntamente com as associações funcionais dos traços linguísticos;

Translated passage 18 from (pt):
Research is undertaken to identify the linguistic features to be included in the analysis, along with the functional associations of the linguistic features;

Improved passage 18:
this research aims to understand how language is used in a particular context or for a specific purpose. Linguistic features refer to the various elements of language, such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, phonetics, and discourse markers. These features are analyzed to determine their role and significance in communication.

The first step in this research is to identify the linguistic features that are relevant to the analysis. This may involve examining previous studies, consulting linguistic theories, or conducting pilot studies to identify the key elements of language that are important in the given context.

Once the linguistic features are identified, the next step is to determine their functional associations. This involves understanding how these features are used to convey meaning, express emotions, establish social relationships, or achieve specific communicative goals. For example, certain vocabulary choices may be associated with formality or informality, while specific grammatical structures may be used to convey politeness or assertiveness.

To determine the functional associations of linguistic features, researchers may employ various methods such as discourse analysis, conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, or experimental studies. These methods help in examining how language is used in real-life situations and how different linguistic features contribute to the overall communicative function.

Overall, the research on linguistic features and their functional associations provides insights into how language is structured and used in different contexts, helping us understand the complexities of human communication.

Passage 19:
Os programas de computador são desenvolvidos para análise gramatical automatizada, para identificar ou 'marcar' todos os recursos linguísticos relevantes em textos;

Translated passage 19 from (pt):
Computer programs are developed for automated grammar analysis to identify or &#39;mark&#39; all relevant linguistic features in texts;

Improved passage 19:
these features can include parts of speech, sentence structure, word order, verb tense, and more. The purpose of automated grammar analysis is to assist in language learning, proofreading, and text analysis.

Computer programs use various algorithms and techniques to analyze the grammar of a given text. One common approach is to use rule-based systems, where a set of predefined grammar rules is applied to the text. These rules can be based on linguistic theories or language-specific guidelines.

Another approach is statistical analysis, where the program uses machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of text data and learn patterns of grammar usage. This approach can be more flexible and adaptable to different languages and contexts.

Automated grammar analysis programs can provide feedback on grammar errors, suggest corrections, and highlight areas that need improvement. They can also generate detailed reports on the grammatical features of a text, such as the frequency of certain grammatical structures or the distribution of different parts of speech.

However, it's important to note that automated grammar analysis is not perfect and may not always capture the nuances of language. Contextual understanding, idiomatic expressions, and stylistic choices are often challenging for computer programs to analyze accurately. Therefore, human proofreading and interpretation are still necessary for accurate and comprehensive language analysis.

Passage 20:
Todo o corpus de textos é etiquetado automaticamente por computador, e todos os textos são editados interativamente para garantir que os recursos linguísticos sejam identificados com precisão;

Translated passage 20 from (pt):
The entire corpus of texts is automatically computer tagged, and all texts are interactively edited to ensure that language features are accurately identified;

Improved passage 20:
this process is known as text annotation. Text annotation involves the identification and labeling of various linguistic elements in a text, such as parts of speech, named entities, syntactic structures, sentiment, and other language features.

To automatically computer tag the entire corpus of texts, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are commonly employed. NLP algorithms analyze the text and assign appropriate tags or labels to different elements based on predefined rules or statistical models. These tags help in understanding the structure and meaning of the text.

However, automatic tagging is not always perfect, and errors or inaccuracies can occur. Therefore, interactive editing is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the language features identified by the computer. Human annotators review and correct any mislabeled or missed elements, improving the quality of the annotations.

The interactive editing process may involve manually correcting tags, adding missing annotations, or removing incorrect ones. It requires linguistic expertise and a deep understanding of the language features being annotated. The goal is to create a high-quality annotated corpus that can be used for various language-related tasks, such as machine learning, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and more.

Overall, the combination of automatic computer tagging and interactive editing ensures that language features are accurately identified in the corpus, providing a valuable resource for linguistic analysis and computational applications.

Passage 21:
Programas de computador adicionais são desenvolvidos e executados para computar contagens de frequência normalizadas de cada recurso linguístico em cada texto do corpus;

Translated passage 21 from (pt):
Additional computer programs are developed and run to compute normalized frequency counts of each language feature in each text in the corpus;

Improved passage 21:
these counts are then used to calculate various linguistic measures such as lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and semantic similarity. The programs analyze the texts at different levels, including phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics, to capture a comprehensive understanding of the language features present in each text.

The normalized frequency counts provide a quantitative measure of how frequently each language feature occurs in a text relative to the total number of words or sentences. This allows researchers to compare and contrast the language features across different texts and identify patterns or trends.

For example, lexical diversity measures the variety of words used in a text. By calculating the normalized frequency counts of unique words in each text, researchers can determine the richness of vocabulary and the level of lexical diversity. This information can be useful in studying language development, language proficiency, or even authorship attribution.

Syntactic complexity measures the complexity of sentence structures in a text. By analyzing the normalized frequency counts of different syntactic structures such as clauses, phrases, or sentence types, researchers can assess the syntactic complexity of a text. This information can be valuable in studying language acquisition, language processing, or even language disorders.

Semantic similarity measures the similarity of meaning between words or sentences in a text. By computing the normalized frequency counts of semantic features such as word associations, semantic relations, or semantic categories, researchers can determine the semantic similarity between texts. This information can be applied in various fields, including natural language processing, information retrieval, or machine translation.

Overall, the development and use of computer programs to compute normalized frequency counts of language features in a corpus enable researchers to conduct quantitative analyses and gain insights into various linguistic aspects. These programs provide a systematic and efficient way to analyze large amounts of text data and contribute to advancements in linguistics and related fields.

Passage 22:
Os padrões de co-ocorrência entre traços linguísticos são identificados através de uma análise fatorial das contagens de frequência;

Translated passage 22 from (pt):
Patterns of co-occurrence between linguistic features are identified through a factor analysis of frequency counts;

Improved passage 22:
this analysis helps to identify relationships between different linguistic features based on how often they occur together in a given dataset. Factor analysis is a statistical technique that aims to explain the variance in a set of variables by identifying underlying factors that contribute to their co-occurrence.

In the context of linguistics, factor analysis can be used to uncover patterns of co-occurrence between various linguistic features, such as phonetic, syntactic, or semantic features. For example, researchers may analyze a corpus of spoken language to identify patterns of co-occurrence between certain phonetic features, such as vowel quality or consonant clusters. By examining the frequency counts of these features, factor analysis can reveal underlying factors that explain their co-occurrence, such as regional dialects or speech styles.

Factor analysis can also be applied to syntactic or semantic features to uncover patterns of co-occurrence between different grammatical structures or word meanings. For instance, researchers may analyze a corpus of written texts to identify patterns of co-occurrence between certain syntactic constructions, such as passive voice or relative clauses. By examining the frequency counts of these constructions, factor analysis can reveal underlying factors that explain their co-occurrence, such as genre or discourse context.

Overall, factor analysis of frequency counts helps to uncover patterns of co-occurrence between linguistic features, providing insights into the underlying factors that contribute to their relationship. This analysis can be useful for understanding language variation, language change, or language processing, among other linguistic phenomena.

Passage 23:
Os “fatores” da análise fatorial são interpretados funcionalmente como dimensões subjacentes de variação;

Translated passage 23 from (pt):
The “factors” of factor analysis are interpreted functionally as underlying dimensions of variation;

Improved passage 23:
they represent the latent variables that explain the observed correlations among a set of variables. These factors are not directly observable but are inferred from the patterns of correlations among the observed variables.

Factor analysis is a statistical technique used to identify these underlying dimensions or factors. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by grouping variables that are highly correlated with each other. By doing so, it provides a more concise representation of the data and helps in understanding the underlying structure or dimensions that drive the observed correlations.

The interpretation of these factors is subjective and depends on the context of the study. Researchers often assign labels or names to these factors based on their understanding of the variables involved. For example, in a study on personality traits, the factors may be interpreted as extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, etc.

The factors extracted through factor analysis can be used for various purposes, such as creating composite scores, developing scales or questionnaires, identifying underlying dimensions in psychological or social phenomena, and exploring the relationships between variables.

Overall, the factors in factor analysis represent the underlying dimensions of variation that explain the observed correlations among a set of variables, and their interpretation is based on the context and understanding of the researcher.

Passage 24:
Os escores de dimensão para cada texto são calculados; os escores médios das dimensões para cada registro são então comparados para analisar as semelhanças e diferenças linguísticas salientes entre os registros.

Translated passage 24 from (pt):
Dimension scores for each text are calculated; the mean dimension scores for each record are then compared to analyze salient linguistic similarities and differences between the records.

Improved passage 24:
This analysis method involves calculating dimension scores for each text and then comparing the mean dimension scores for each record. The purpose is to identify significant linguistic similarities and differences between the records.

To perform this analysis, the following steps can be followed:

1. Define the dimensions: Determine the specific linguistic dimensions that you want to analyze. These dimensions could include factors such as sentiment, formality, complexity, or any other relevant linguistic characteristic.

2. Assign scores: Develop a scoring system for each dimension. This could involve rating each text on a scale (e.g., 1-5) for each dimension or using a more complex scoring method based on linguistic analysis techniques.

3. Calculate dimension scores: Apply the scoring system to each text to calculate the dimension scores. This will result in a set of scores for each dimension for each text.

4. Calculate mean dimension scores: For each record, calculate the mean dimension scores by averaging the scores across all texts within that record. This will provide a single value for each dimension for each record.

5. Compare mean dimension scores: Compare the mean dimension scores across different records to identify salient linguistic similarities and differences. Look for patterns or significant deviations in the mean scores for each dimension.

6. Interpret the results: Analyze the findings and interpret the results. Identify any consistent patterns or differences in the mean dimension scores that could indicate linguistic similarities or differences between the records.

It is important to note that the specific scoring system and dimensions used will depend on the research question or objective of the analysis. Additionally, statistical tests or visualizations can be used to further analyze and interpret the results, depending on the complexity of the data and research goals.

Passage 25:
Em um estudo sobre o discurso da academia sob uma perspectiva multidimensional, Berber Sardinha (2020, p. 302-303, tradução nossa) propôs o uso de uma derivação da AMD conhecida como AMD lexical que

Translated passage 25 from (pt):
In a study on academic discourse from a multidimensional perspective, Berber Sardinha (2020, p. 302-303, our translation) proposed the use of a derivation of AMD known as lexical AMD that

Improved passage 25:
focuses specifically on the analysis of lexical features in academic discourse. This approach aims to examine the role of vocabulary and word choice in shaping the discourse and conveying meaning.

Lexical AMD involves the identification and analysis of various lexical features, such as word frequency, word length, word complexity, and word connotation. By examining these features, researchers can gain insights into how specific lexical choices contribute to the overall discourse.

For example, the frequency of certain words or phrases can indicate their importance or relevance in a particular academic field. Word length and complexity can reflect the level of formality or technicality in the discourse. Additionally, word connotation can reveal the underlying attitudes or perspectives conveyed by the author.

By applying lexical AMD, researchers can uncover patterns and trends in academic discourse that may not be apparent through other analytical approaches. This method provides a more nuanced understanding of how vocabulary and word choice shape the communication of ideas in academic writing.

Overall, lexical AMD offers a valuable perspective on academic discourse by focusing on the role of vocabulary and lexical features. It enhances our understanding of how language choices contribute to the construction of meaning and knowledge in academic contexts.

Passage 26:
Ao contrário de uma Análise MD “tradicional”, que usa principalmente recursos gramaticais e cujo objetivo geral é identificar dimensões funcionais de variação de registro, uma Análise MD lexical usa unidades lexicais (palavras, n-gramas, colocações) para identificar as dimensões. (BERBER SARDINHA, 2020, p. 302-303, tradução nossa)

Translated passage 26 from (pt):
Unlike a “traditional” MD Analysis, which primarily uses grammatical features and whose general aim is to identify functional dimensions of record variation, a lexical MD Analysis uses lexical units (words, n-grams, collocations) to identify dimensions. (BERBER SARDINHA, 2020, p. 302-303, our translation)

Improved passage 26:
In other words, while a traditional MD Analysis focuses on the grammatical aspects of a text and aims to identify how different records vary in terms of their function, a lexical MD Analysis focuses on the use of specific words, word combinations (n-grams), and collocations to identify these dimensions of variation.

Passage 27:
Segundo Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 103-104), a AMD, por sua natureza cumulativa, é uma abordagem adequada para análises de corpora que crescem de forma incremental.

Translated passage 27 from (pt):
According to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 103-104), AMD, due to its cumulative nature, is a suitable approach for analyzing corpora that grow incrementally.

Improved passage 27:
AMD, or Accumulated Mean Differences, is a statistical measure used in corpus linguistics to analyze language variation and change over time. It calculates the mean difference between two or more corpora at different time points, allowing researchers to identify linguistic patterns and trends.

Berber Sardinha (2000) suggests that AMD is particularly useful for analyzing corpora that grow incrementally. This means that as new data is added to the corpus over time, AMD can be used to measure the linguistic changes that occur. By comparing the mean differences between different time points, researchers can track the evolution of language use and identify significant shifts or developments.

The cumulative nature of AMD makes it suitable for studying long-term language change, as it takes into account the entire corpus history. This allows researchers to capture the gradual linguistic transformations that occur over time, rather than focusing solely on individual time points.

Overall, AMD provides a valuable tool for analyzing corpora that grow incrementally, enabling researchers to study language variation and change in a systematic and quantitative manner.

Passage 28:
A pesquisa em Linguística de Corpus requer um design e preparação de corpora criteriosos. Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338) define um corpus como

Translated passage 28 from (pt):
Research in Corpus Linguistics requires careful corpora design and preparation. Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338) defines a corpus as

Improved passage 28:
"a principled collection of authentic texts that are representative of a particular language or language variety, and that are stored in a computer-readable format for linguistic analysis."

Corpus linguistics is a research approach that involves the analysis of large collections of texts, known as corpora, to investigate various linguistic phenomena. These corpora are carefully designed and prepared to ensure that they are representative of the language or language variety being studied.

According to Sanchez (1995), a corpus is a collection of authentic texts that are selected based on specific criteria to ensure their representativeness. These texts can include written materials such as books, newspapers, and websites, as well as spoken materials such as transcriptions of conversations or speeches.

The corpus is stored in a computer-readable format, which allows for efficient and systematic analysis using computational tools and techniques. This format can vary depending on the specific research goals and requirements, but common formats include plain text files, XML files, or specialized corpus software formats.

Careful corpus design and preparation are crucial in corpus linguistics research to ensure the reliability and validity of the findings. This involves selecting appropriate texts that cover a wide range of linguistic features and genres, as well as ensuring that the corpus is balanced and representative of the target language or language variety.

Additionally, the corpus should be annotated or tagged with linguistic information, such as part-of-speech tags or syntactic structures, to facilitate analysis and interpretation. This annotation process can be done manually or using automated tools, depending on the size and complexity of the corpus.

Overall, corpus design and preparation are essential steps in corpus linguistics research, as they lay the foundation for accurate and meaningful analysis of linguistic phenomena.

Passage 29:
Um conjunto de dados linguísticos (pertencentes ao uso oral ou escrito da língua, ou a ambos), sistematizados segundo determinados critérios, suficientemente extensos em amplitude e profundidade, de maneira que sejam representativos da totalidade do uso linguístico ou de algum de seus âmbitos, dispostos de tal modo que possam ser processados por computador, com a finalidade de propiciar resultados vários e úteis para a descrição e análise. (SANCHEZ, 1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338)

Translated passage 29 from (pt):
A set of linguistic data (pertaining to the oral or written use of the language, or both), systematized according to certain criteria, sufficiently extensive in breadth and depth, so that they are representative of the totality of linguistic use or some of its scopes, arranged in such a way that they can be processed by computer, with the purpose of providing various and useful results for description and analysis. (SANCHEZ, 1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338)

Improved passage 29:
This definition refers to a corpus, which is a collection of linguistic data that is organized and processed by a computer for the purpose of description and analysis. The data can be in the form of oral or written language, or both, and should be extensive enough to represent the entirety or specific aspects of linguistic use. The corpus is systematized according to certain criteria and can provide various useful results for studying language.

Passage 30:
Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 338-339) enumera quatro pré-requisitos para a elaboração de um corpus:

Translated passage 30 from (pt):
Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 338-339) lists four prerequisites for the elaboration of a corpus:

Improved passage 30:
1. Clear research objectives: Before starting the corpus development process, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the research objectives. This includes identifying the specific linguistic phenomena or research questions that the corpus will address.

2. Representative sample: The corpus should be representative of the target language or language variety. This means that it should include a diverse range of texts or language samples that accurately reflect the linguistic features, genres, and registers of the language being studied.

3. Ethical considerations: Corpus development involves collecting and storing language data, which may raise ethical concerns. Researchers should ensure that they obtain informed consent from participants and follow ethical guidelines for data collection and storage.

4. Annotation guidelines: Corpus annotation involves adding linguistic information to the corpus, such as part-of-speech tags or syntactic structures. It is important to establish clear annotation guidelines to ensure consistency and reliability in the annotation process. These guidelines should be well-documented and followed by all annotators involved in the corpus development.

Passage 31:
O corpus deve consistir de textos autênticos em linguagem natural, não produzidos especificamente para pesquisa linguística nem produzidos artificialmente por programas de computador;

Translated passage 31 from (pt):
The corpus must consist of authentic texts in natural language, not produced specifically for linguistic research nor artificially produced by computer programs;

Improved passage 31:
it should be composed of texts that are written or spoken by native speakers in their everyday communication. These texts can include various genres such as news articles, books, conversations, social media posts, emails, and more.

The requirement for authenticity ensures that the corpus reflects the natural usage of language, including its nuances, idiomatic expressions, and variations. It allows researchers to study and analyze language as it is actually used by native speakers in real-life situations.

On the other hand, texts specifically created for linguistic research or artificially generated by computer programs may not accurately represent the complexities and subtleties of natural language. They might lack the spontaneity, cultural references, and contextual information that are present in authentic texts.

By using authentic texts, researchers can gain insights into various linguistic phenomena, such as syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and sociolinguistics. They can also investigate language variation across different regions, social groups, and time periods.

Overall, the use of authentic texts in a corpus is crucial for linguistic research as it provides a reliable and representative source of language data for analysis and understanding.

Passage 32:
Se os textos foram produzidos por falantes não nativos, o corpus deve ser qualificado como um corpus de aprendizes;

Translated passage 32 from (pt):
If the texts were produced by non-native speakers, the corpus must be qualified as a corpus of learners;

Improved passage 32:
however, if the texts were produced by native speakers, the corpus would not necessarily be qualified as a corpus of learners.

Passage 33:
O corpus deve ser adequado ao seu propósito no sentido de que deve ser elaborado de acordo com os requisitos de sua pesquisa correspondente;

Translated passage 33 from (pt):
The corpus must be fit for purpose in the sense that it must be constructed in accordance with the requirements of its corresponding research;

Improved passage 33:
otherwise, the results and findings derived from the corpus may not be valid or reliable. 

To ensure that the corpus is fit for purpose, several considerations need to be taken into account. 

Firstly, the corpus should be representative of the target language or domain. It should include a diverse range of texts that accurately reflect the language usage and characteristics of the research area. This can be achieved by selecting texts from various sources, such as books, articles, websites, and other relevant materials.

Secondly, the corpus should be of sufficient size to provide reliable and meaningful results. The size of the corpus will depend on the research objectives and the specific research questions being investigated. Generally, a larger corpus is preferred as it allows for more robust statistical analysis and generalization of findings.

Thirdly, the corpus should be annotated or tagged appropriately to facilitate the analysis and extraction of relevant linguistic features. This may involve adding part-of-speech tags, syntactic annotations, semantic labels, or other linguistic annotations depending on the research requirements.

Furthermore, the corpus should be well-documented, including information about its composition, sources, and any preprocessing steps that have been applied. This documentation is crucial for transparency and reproducibility, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon the findings.

Lastly, the corpus should be regularly updated and maintained to ensure its relevance and usefulness over time. Language usage and patterns evolve, and new texts and genres emerge, so it is important to periodically update the corpus to capture these changes.

In summary, constructing a fit-for-purpose corpus requires careful consideration of its representativeness, size, annotation, documentation, and maintenance. By adhering to these principles, researchers can ensure that their corpus is reliable, valid, and suitable for their specific research needs.

Passage 34:
O corpus deve ser representativo. Embora esse seja um requisito que não pode ser determinado objetivamente, um corpus maior geralmente é mais representativo do que um menor porque pode conter mais ocorrências de traços linguísticos de baixa frequência (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 343).

Translated passage 34 from (pt):
The corpus must be representative. Although this is a requirement that cannot be objectively determined, a larger corpus is generally more representative than a smaller one because it may contain more occurrences of low-frequency linguistic features (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 343).

Improved passage 34:
A representative corpus is one that accurately reflects the language being studied in terms of its various linguistic features, such as vocabulary, grammar, and discourse patterns. It should cover a wide range of text types, genres, and registers to capture the diversity of language usage.

The size of a corpus plays a crucial role in its representativeness. A larger corpus is more likely to include a greater number of occurrences of low-frequency linguistic features. These features may be specific words, phrases, or grammatical constructions that are not commonly used but are still important for understanding the language.

For example, if a corpus is too small, it may not include enough instances of rare words or specialized terminology that are crucial for certain domains or fields of study. This can lead to an incomplete understanding of the language and its usage in specific contexts.

On the other hand, a larger corpus has a higher chance of including a sufficient number of occurrences of these low-frequency features. This allows researchers to analyze and study them more accurately, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the language.

However, it is important to note that the size of a corpus alone does not guarantee its representativeness. Other factors, such as the selection criteria for texts and the balance of different text types, also play a significant role. Therefore, researchers need to carefully consider these factors when creating or selecting a corpus to ensure its representativeness.

Passage 35:
Segundo Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), deve ser responsabilidade do pesquisador demonstrar o quão representativo e adequado é um corpus para seu estudo.

Translated passage 35 from (pt):
According to Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), it should be the researcher&#39;s responsibility to demonstrate how representative and adequate a corpus is for their study.

Improved passage 35:
Yes, according to Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), it is the responsibility of the researcher to demonstrate the representativeness and adequacy of the corpus they are using for their study. This means that the researcher should provide evidence or justification for why the chosen corpus is suitable for their research objectives and questions. They should explain how the corpus was compiled, what criteria were used for inclusion or exclusion of texts, and how it reflects the target population or phenomenon under investigation. By doing so, the researcher ensures transparency and allows for the evaluation and replication of their study by others.

Passage 36:
O tamanho de um corpus é definido por três dimensões (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 344):

Translated passage 36 from (pt):
The size of a corpus is defined by three dimensions (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 344):

Improved passage 36:
1. Number of texts: The size of a corpus can be determined by the number of texts it contains. This refers to the total count of individual documents or pieces of text that are included in the corpus. The more texts a corpus has, the larger its size.

2. Text length: Another dimension that defines the size of a corpus is the length of the texts within it. This refers to the number of words, sentences, or characters in each text. A corpus with longer texts will generally be considered larger than one with shorter texts, even if they have the same number of documents.

3. Text diversity: The diversity of texts in a corpus also contributes to its size. This dimension refers to the variety of genres, topics, or sources represented in the corpus. A corpus that includes texts from a wide range of domains or genres will be considered larger in terms of its coverage and representativeness.

These three dimensions collectively determine the size of a corpus and can be used to compare and classify different corpora based on their scale and scope.

Passage 37:
Número de palavras;

Translated passage 37 from (pt):
Number of words;

Improved passage 37:
There are approximately 171,476 words in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. However, this number is constantly changing as new words are added and old words become obsolete.

O corpus ALBP será projetado e carregado inicialmente com os textos produzidos no segundo semestre de 2023. À medida que o projeto avança, espera-se que ele cresça gradualmente.

Translated passage 60 from (pt):
The ALBP corpus will be initially designed and loaded with texts produced in the second half of 2023. As the project progresses, it is expected to gradually grow.

Improved passage 60:
The ALBP corpus, which stands for "Artificial Language Benchmarking Project" corpus, is a linguistic resource that will be created for benchmarking and evaluating artificial language models. Initially, the corpus will be populated with texts that are generated in the latter half of 2023. These texts will serve as the foundation for the corpus.

However, as the project advances and more data becomes available, the ALBP corpus is anticipated to expand gradually. This growth will involve the addition of new texts, which will contribute to the diversity and richness of the corpus. The continuous expansion of the corpus will enable researchers and developers to have access to a larger and more comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating artificial language models.

Figure 2: Project Timeline

1. Initial script development: The necessary computer scripts will be developed in parallel with the project initiation. This will involve creating the basic framework for data analysis and visualization.

2. Multidimensional analysis: Once the initial scripts are ready, multidimensional analyzes will be performed. This will involve analyzing data from multiple dimensions, such as time, location, and various variables of interest.

3. Refinement of analysis: As the project progresses, the initial analysis results will be refined. This may involve adjusting parameters, incorporating additional data sources, or improving the accuracy of the analysis.

4. Expansion of analysis: Based on the refined analysis, the scope of the analysis will be expanded. This may involve exploring new dimensions, incorporating additional variables, or conducting more detailed analyses.

5. Iterative process: The process of refining and expanding the analysis will be iterative, with each iteration building upon the previous one. This will allow for continuous improvement and optimization of the analysis.

By following this timeline and iterative approach, the necessary computer scripts will be prepared, and the multidimensional analysis will be performed, refined, and expanded as the project progresses. This will ensure that the analysis is comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the project objectives.

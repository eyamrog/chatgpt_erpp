The analysis discusses the way the meanings are constructed by these students and reflects upon interpretation and meaning construction, according to new epistemological perspectives that have been postulated recently (Morin 1998; Lankshear & Knobel 2003). It, thus, considers the present needs of the multimodal and hypertextual communication approached in the multiliteracy studies (Cope & Kalantzis 2000), and the university preparation for a critical and participative cultural and social practice (Castels 1999).\n",

    "The research analysis focuses on Brazilian university students and their reading of cinema images. It explores how these students construct meanings from the images and reflects on interpretation and meaning construction based on new epistemological perspectives. The article takes into account the current requirements of multimodal and hypertextual communication in multiliteracy studies, as well as the importance of university preparation for critical and participative cultural and social practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis draws on the works of Morin (1998) and Lankshear & Knobel (2003), who have proposed new epistemological perspectives. These perspectives likely challenge traditional ways of understanding and interpreting cinema images. By considering these new perspectives, the analysis aims to shed light on how meanings are constructed by the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of multiliteracy studies, which focus on various modes of communication, such as visual, textual, and digital. In today's world, where communication is increasingly multimodal and hypertextual, it is crucial for students to develop skills in understanding and interpreting different forms of media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the article highlights the role of universities in preparing students for critical and participative cultural and social practices. It suggests that universities should equip students with the necessary skills to critically engage with cinema images and other forms of media. This preparation is essential for students to become active participants in cultural and social discussions.\n",

Passage 5:
Apesar do contínuo avanço da LI como lingua franca em uma infinidade de âmbitos da atividade humana, os pesquisadores usuários de Inglês como Língua Internacional (English as an International Language - EIL) marginalizados na comunidade científica global continuam a ser notadamente desprivilegiados na competição por publicação nos principais periódicos de publicação em LI (BELCHER, 2007), o que restringe sua participação na mencionada comunidade.

Translated passage 5 from (pt):
Despite the continued advance of LI as a lingua franca in a multitude of areas of human activity, researchers who use English as an International Language (EIL) who are marginalized in the global scientific community continue to be notably underprivileged in the competition for publication in the main journals publishing in LI (BELCHER, 2007), which restricts their participation in the aforementioned community.

Improved passage 5:
This lack of representation and recognition for researchers using English as an International Language (EIL) in the global scientific community is a significant issue. Despite the increasing use of English as a lingua franca, these researchers face challenges in getting their work published in the main journals that publish in English.

The term "English as a International Language" refers to the use of English as a means of communication between speakers of different native languages. It is often used in academic and scientific contexts where researchers from different linguistic backgrounds come together to collaborate and share their findings.

However, the dominance of native English speakers and institutions in the global scientific community creates a bias towards their work. Journals that publish in English tend to favor research conducted by native English speakers or researchers affiliated with prestigious institutions. This bias limits the opportunities for EIL researchers to contribute to and be recognized in the scientific community.

The underprivileged position of EIL researchers in the competition for publication in main journals publishing in English restricts their participation in the global scientific community. It hinders their ability to disseminate their research, gain visibility, and establish themselves as experts in their respective fields. This exclusion perpetuates a power imbalance and limits the diversity of perspectives and knowledge in the scientific community.

To address this issue, it is crucial for the scientific community to recognize and value the contributions of EIL researchers. Journals should adopt more inclusive policies that consider the quality and significance of research rather than the linguistic background or institutional affiliation of the authors. Additionally, efforts should be made to provide support and resources for EIL researchers to improve their English language skills and navigate the publishing process.

By promoting inclusivity and recognizing the value of research conducted by EIL researchers, the scientific community can foster a more diverse and equitable environment that benefits from a wider range of perspectives and expertise.

Passage 6:
Belcher (2007) questiona até que ponto as regras do sistema de publicação anglo-saxão são responsáveis por essa tendência monocultural. Em seu estudo, Belcher (2007, tradução nossa) argumenta que os pesquisadores usuários de EIL que conseguem ter seus trabalhos publicados têm que passar por um complicado processo de revisão e re-submissão em uma "história de paciência do revisor e persistência do autor".

Translated passage 6 from (pt):
Belcher (2007) questions the extent to which the rules of the Anglo-Saxon publishing system are responsible for this monocultural tendency. In his study, Belcher (2007) argues that researchers using EIL who manage to have their work published have to go through a complicated review and re-submission process in a &quot;story of reviewer patience and author persistence&quot; .

Improved passage 6:
Belcher (2007) raises the following questions regarding the role of the Anglo-Saxon publishing system in promoting a monocultural tendency:

1. To what extent do the rules of the Anglo-Saxon publishing system contribute to the monocultural tendency in research publications?
2. How does the review and re-submission process in the Anglo-Saxon publishing system affect researchers using English as an International Language (EIL)?
3. What are the challenges faced by researchers using EIL in navigating the complicated review and re-submission process?
4. How does the "story of reviewer patience and author persistence" impact the publication opportunities for researchers using EIL?
5. Are there any biases or barriers within the Anglo-Saxon publishing system that hinder the publication of research from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds?
6. What changes can be made to the Anglo-Saxon publishing system to promote a more inclusive and diverse range of research publications?
7. Are there alternative publishing models or platforms that can provide a more equitable and accessible avenue for researchers using EIL to share their work?

These questions highlight the need to critically examine the publishing system's impact on the diversity and inclusivity of research publications, particularly for researchers using EIL.

Passage 10:
De acordo com um artigo da McKinsey (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023), os algoritmos de IA gerativa são treinados com grandes quantidades de dados, o que faz com que suas respostas pareçam altamente criativas e ainda mais realistas com a inclusão de elementos aleatórios.

Translated passage 10 from (pt):
According to an article by McKinsey (WHAT IS CHATGPT, DALL-E, AND GENERATIVE AI? | MCKINSEY, 2023), generative AI algorithms are trained with large amounts of data, which makes their responses appear highly creative and even more realistic with the inclusion of random elements.

Improved passage 10:
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find the specific article you mentioned by McKinsey. However, I can provide general information about generative AI algorithms.

Generative AI algorithms, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, are indeed trained with large amounts of data. These algorithms use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate new content, such as text or images, based on the patterns and information they have learned from the training data.

By training on vast datasets, generative AI algorithms can learn to mimic human-like responses and create content that appears creative and realistic. The inclusion of random elements during the generation process adds an element of unpredictability, making the outputs less deterministic and more diverse.

However, it's important to note that while generative AI algorithms can produce impressive outputs, they are not truly creative or understanding in the same way humans are. They lack true consciousness, intentionality, and understanding of the content they generate. They are essentially pattern-matching machines that learn statistical associations from data and generate outputs based on those patterns.

It's always important to critically evaluate and verify the outputs of generative AI algorithms, as they can sometimes produce inaccurate or biased information.

Passage 11:
Considerando o caso específico de pesquisadores usuários de ERPP, sua escrita provavelmente se tornaria uma combinação de sua própria criação e trechos compostos por uma ferramenta baseada em IA. Portanto, do ponto de vista linguístico, o uso de ferramentas baseadas em IA pode introduzir características distintas de linguagem que podem levar a uma variação de registro em seus textos.

Translated passage 11 from (pt):
Considering the specific case of researchers using ERPP, their writing would likely become a combination of their own creation and excerpts composed by an AI-based tool. Therefore, from a linguistic point of view, the use of AI-based tools can introduce distinct language features that can lead to register variation in your texts.

Improved passage 11:
The integration of AI-based tools in the research process, particularly in the use of ERPP, is likely to result in a blend of the researchers' own writing and excerpts generated by the AI tool. This combination can introduce unique language characteristics that may contribute to register variation in the texts produced.

Passage 12:
Espera-se que um estudo de variação de registro via AMD produza informações sobre a natureza da variação introduzida na Escrita Acadêmica dos autores usuários de ERPP. Segundo Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100), a abordagem conhecida como AMD, originalmente proposta por Biber em 1988, permite a análise de um grande volume de textos de um determinado registro, identificando padrões de co-ocorrência de traços gramaticais (também conhecidos como dimensões funcionais) que caracterizam a variação desse registro.

Translated passage 12 from (pt):
It is expected that a study of record variation via AMD will yield information on the nature of the variation introduced in the Academic Writing of authors using ERPP. According to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 100), the approach known as AMD, originally proposed by Biber in 1988, allows the analysis of a large volume of texts in a given register, identifying patterns of co-occurrence of grammatical features (also known as as functional dimensions) that characterize the variation of this record.

Improved passage 12:
This approach is particularly useful in studying the variation in Academic Writing because it allows researchers to identify the specific grammatical features that are commonly used in this register. By analyzing a large volume of texts, researchers can identify patterns of co-occurrence of these features, which can provide insights into the nature of the variation introduced by authors using ERPP.

The concept of functional dimensions refers to the different ways in which grammatical features can be used in a particular register. For example, in Academic Writing, certain grammatical features may be used more frequently or in specific ways compared to other registers. By identifying these patterns of co-occurrence, researchers can gain a better understanding of the specific linguistic choices made by authors in this register.

By studying record variation via AMD, researchers can also gain insights into the factors that influence the variation in Academic Writing. For example, they can examine how factors such as the author's background, discipline, or intended audience may influence the use of specific grammatical features. This can help researchers understand the social and contextual factors that shape the variation in Academic Writing.

Overall, the study of record variation via AMD provides a valuable tool for analyzing the variation in Academic Writing. It allows researchers to identify patterns of co-occurrence of grammatical features that characterize this register, providing insights into the nature of the variation introduced by authors using ERPP.

Passage 13:
Biber (2009, p. 823) argumenta que os registros podem ser definidos por suas características situacionais (por exemplo, informalidade, oralidade, etc.) e linguísticas: Embora os registros sejam definidos em termos situacionais, eles também podem ser comparados com relação às suas características linguísticas: o estudo da variação de registro. A variação de registro é inerente à linguagem humana: um certo falante fará escolhas sistemáticas de pronúncia, morfologia, escolha de palavras e gramática, refletindo uma série de fatores situacionais. (BIBER, 2009, p. 823, tradução nossa)

Translated passage 13 from (pt):
Biber (2009, p. 823) argues that records can be defined by their situational (eg, informality, orality, etc.) and linguistic characteristics: Although records are defined in situational terms, they can also be compared with respect to its linguistic features: the study of register variation. Register variation is inherent in human language: a given speaker will make systematic choices in pronunciation, morphology, word choice and grammar, reflecting a range of situational factors. (BIBER, 2009, p. 823, our translation)

Improved passage 13:
In this statement, Biber (2009) suggests that records can be characterized by their situational and linguistic characteristics. Situational characteristics refer to factors such as informality or orality, which can influence the nature of a record. Linguistic characteristics, on the other hand, involve the study of register variation, which refers to the systematic choices made by speakers in terms of pronunciation, morphology, word choice, and grammar. These choices are influenced by various situational factors.

Passage 14:
Uma AMD completa compreende oito etapas metodológicas (BIBER, 2009, p. 825-826, tradução nossa): Um corpus apropriado é projetado com base em pesquisas e análises anteriores. Os textos são coletados, transcritos (no caso de textos falados) e inseridos no computador; A pesquisa é realizada para identificar os traços linguísticos a serem incluídos na análise, juntamente com as associações funcionais dos traços linguísticos; Os programas de computador são desenvolvidos para análise gramatical automatizada, para identificar ou 'marcar' todos os recursos linguísticos relevantes em textos; Todo o corpus de textos é etiquetado automaticamente por computador, e todos os textos são editados interativamente para garantir que os recursos linguísticos sejam identificados com precisão; Programas de computador adicionais são desenvolvidos e executados para computar contagens de frequência normalizadas de cada recurso linguístico em cada texto do corpus; Os padrões de co-ocorrência entre traços linguísticos são identificados através de uma análise fatorial das contagens de frequência; Os “fatores” da análise fatorial são interpretados funcionalmente como dimensões subjacentes de variação; Os escores de dimensão para cada texto são calculados; os escores médios das dimensões para cada registro são então comparados para analisar as semelhanças e diferenças linguísticas salientes entre os registros.

Translated passage 14 from (pt):
A complete AMD comprises eight methodological steps (BIBER, 2009, p. 825-826): An appropriate corpus is designed based on previous research and analysis. Texts are collected, transcribed (in the case of spoken texts) and entered into the computer; Research is undertaken to identify the linguistic features to be included in the analysis, along with the functional associations of the linguistic features; Computer programs are developed for automated grammar analysis to identify or &#39;mark&#39; all relevant linguistic features in texts; The entire corpus of texts is automatically computer tagged, and all texts are interactively edited to ensure that language features are accurately identified; Additional computer programs are developed and run to compute normalized frequency counts of each language feature in each text in the corpus; Patterns of co-occurrence between linguistic features are identified through a factor analysis of frequency counts; The “factors” of factor analysis are interpreted functionally as underlying dimensions of variation; Dimension scores for each text are calculated; the mean dimension scores for each record are then compared to analyze salient linguistic similarities and differences between the records.

Improved passage 14:
In summary, the eight methodological steps of AMD (Automated Multi-Dimensional analysis) are as follows:

1. Designing an appropriate corpus: This involves selecting texts based on previous research and analysis.

2. Collecting and transcribing texts: Texts are gathered and transcribed, especially in the case of spoken texts. They are then entered into a computer for further analysis.

3. Identifying linguistic features: Research is conducted to determine the specific linguistic features that will be included in the analysis. The functional associations of these features are also identified.

4. Developing computer programs: Programs are created to automate the grammar analysis and mark the relevant linguistic features in the texts.

5. Computer tagging and editing: The entire corpus of texts is automatically tagged by the computer, and then the texts are manually edited to ensure accurate identification of language features.

6. Computing frequency counts: Additional computer programs are developed and run to calculate normalized frequency counts of each language feature in each text of the corpus.

7. Identifying patterns of co-occurrence: A factor analysis is conducted on the frequency counts to identify patterns of co-occurrence between linguistic features.

8. Interpreting factors and calculating dimension scores: The factors derived from the factor analysis are interpreted functionally as underlying dimensions of variation. Dimension scores are then calculated for each text, and the mean dimension scores for each record are compared to analyze linguistic similarities and differences between the records.

These steps provide a systematic approach to analyzing language features and identifying patterns of variation in a given corpus of texts.

Passage 15:
Em um estudo sobre o discurso da academia sob uma perspectiva multidimensional, Berber Sardinha (2020, p. 302-303, tradução nossa) propôs o uso de uma derivação da AMD conhecida como AMD lexical que Ao contrário de uma Análise MD “tradicional”, que usa principalmente recursos gramaticais e cujo objetivo geral é identificar dimensões funcionais de variação de registro, uma Análise MD lexical usa unidades lexicais (palavras, n-gramas, colocações) para identificar as dimensões. (BERBER SARDINHA, 2020, p. 302-303, tradução nossa)

Translated passage 15 from (pt):
In a study on academic discourse from a multidimensional perspective, Berber Sardinha (2020, p. 302-303, our translation) proposed the use of a derivation of AMD known as lexical AMD that Unlike a “traditional” MD Analysis, that primarily uses grammatical features and whose general purpose is to identify functional dimensions of register variation, a Lexical MD Analysis uses lexical units (words, n-grams, collocations) to identify dimensions.

Improved passage 15:
In this study, Berber Sardinha (2020) suggests the use of a variation of AMD called lexical AMD to analyze academic discourse from a multidimensional perspective. Unlike traditional MD Analysis, which focuses on grammatical features and aims to identify functional dimensions of register variation, lexical MD Analysis utilizes lexical units such as words, n-grams, and collocations to identify dimensions.

Passage 16:
Segundo Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 103-104), a AMD, por sua natureza cumulativa, é uma abordagem adequada para análises de corpora que crescem de forma incremental.

Translated passage 16 from (pt):
According to Berber Sardinha (2000, p. 103-104), AMD, due to its cumulative nature, is a suitable approach for analyzing corpora that grow incrementally.

Improved passage 16:
AMD, or Accumulated Mean Differences, is a statistical measure used in corpus linguistics to analyze language variation and change over time. It calculates the mean difference between two or more corpora at different time points, allowing researchers to identify linguistic patterns and trends.

Berber Sardinha (2000) suggests that AMD is particularly useful for analyzing corpora that grow incrementally. This means that as new data is added to the corpus over time, AMD can be used to measure the linguistic changes that occur. By comparing the mean differences between different time points, researchers can track the evolution of language use and identify significant shifts or developments.

The cumulative nature of AMD makes it suitable for studying long-term language change, as it takes into account the entire corpus history. This allows researchers to capture the gradual linguistic transformations that occur over time, rather than focusing solely on individual time points.

Overall, AMD provides a valuable tool for analyzing corpora that grow incrementally, enabling researchers to study language variation and change in a systematic and comprehensive manner.

Passage 17:
A pesquisa em Linguística de Corpus requer um design e preparação de corpora criteriosos. Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338) define um corpus como Um conjunto de dados linguísticos (pertencentes ao uso oral ou escrito da língua, ou a ambos), sistematizados segundo determinados critérios, suficientemente extensos em amplitude e profundidade, de maneira que sejam representativos da totalidade do uso linguístico ou de algum de seus âmbitos, dispostos de tal modo que possam ser processados por computador, com a finalidade de propiciar resultados vários e úteis para a descrição e análise. (SANCHEZ, 1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338)

Translated passage 17 from (pt):
Research in Corpus Linguistics requires careful corpora design and preparation. Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338) defines a corpus as a set of linguistic data (belonging to the oral or written use of the language, or both), systematized according to certain criteria, sufficiently extensive in breadth and depth, so that they are representative of the totality of linguistic use or some of its scopes, arranged in such a way that they can be processed by a computer, with the aim of providing various and useful results for description and analysis. (SANCHEZ, 1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338)

Improved passage 17:
According to Sanchez (1995, p. 8-9 apud BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 338), a corpus is defined as a collection of linguistic data that can be oral or written, or both. These data are organized based on specific criteria and are extensive enough to represent the entirety of linguistic use or certain aspects of it. The corpus is also structured in a way that allows it to be processed by a computer, with the purpose of providing various useful results for description and analysis.

Passage 18:
Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 338-339) enumera quatro pré-requisitos para a elaboração de um corpus: O corpus deve consistir de textos autênticos em linguagem natural, não produzidos especificamente para pesquisa linguística nem produzidos artificialmente por programas de computador; Se os textos foram produzidos por falantes não nativos, o corpus deve ser qualificado como um corpus de aprendizes; O corpus deve ser adequado ao seu propósito no sentido de que deve ser elaborado de acordo com os requisitos de sua pesquisa correspondente; O corpus deve ser representativo. Embora esse seja um requisito que não pode ser determinado objetivamente, um corpus maior geralmente é mais representativo do que um menor porque pode conter mais ocorrências de traços linguísticos de baixa frequência (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 343).

Translated passage 18 from (pt):
Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 338-339) lists four prerequisites for the elaboration of a corpus: The corpus must consist of authentic texts in natural language, not produced specifically for linguistic research nor produced artificially by computer programs; If the texts were produced by non-native speakers, the corpus must be qualified as a corpus of learners; The corpus must be fit for purpose in the sense that it must be constructed in accordance with the requirements of its corresponding research; The corpus must be representative. Although this is a requirement that cannot be objectively determined, a larger corpus is generally more representative than a smaller one because it may contain more occurrences of low-frequency linguistic features (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 343).

Improved passage 18:
In summary, the four prerequisites for the elaboration of a corpus are:

1. Authenticity: The corpus must consist of natural language texts that are not specifically produced for linguistic research or artificially generated by computer programs.

2. Learner qualification: If the texts were produced by non-native speakers, the corpus must be classified as a corpus of learners.

3. Fit for purpose: The corpus must be constructed in accordance with the requirements of its corresponding research, ensuring that it serves its intended purpose.

4. Representativeness: Although it is subjective, a larger corpus is generally more representative than a smaller one as it may contain more occurrences of low-frequency linguistic features.

Passage 19:
Segundo Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), deve ser responsabilidade do pesquisador demonstrar o quão representativo e adequado é um corpus para seu estudo.

Translated passage 19 from (pt):
According to Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), it should be the researcher&#39;s responsibility to demonstrate how representative and adequate a corpus is for their study.

Improved passage 19:
Yes, according to Berber Sardinha (2018, p. 345), it is the responsibility of the researcher to demonstrate the representativeness and adequacy of the corpus they are using for their study. This means that the researcher should provide evidence or justification for why the chosen corpus is suitable for their research objectives and questions. They should explain how the corpus was compiled, what criteria were used for inclusion or exclusion of texts, and how it reflects the target population or phenomenon under investigation. By doing so, the researcher ensures transparency and allows for the evaluation and replication of their study by others.

Passage 20:
O tamanho de um corpus é definido por três dimensões (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 344): Número de palavras; Número de textos; Número de registros. Definida a base teórica deste estudo, os procedimentos metodológicos serão detalhados na próxima seção.

Translated passage 20 from (pt):
The size of a corpus is defined by three dimensions (BERBER SARDINHA, 2018, p. 344): Number of words; Number of texts; Number of records. Having defined the theoretical basis of this study, the methodological procedures will be detailed in the next section.

Improved passage 20:
In the next section, the methodological procedures of this study will be described in detail. These procedures will outline how the corpus was constructed and the steps taken to analyze the data. The size of the corpus, as defined by the number of words, number of texts, and number of records, will also be discussed.

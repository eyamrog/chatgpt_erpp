Passage 1:
This article presents a research analysis in which Brazilian university students were investigated about their reading of cinema images. The analysis discusses the way the meanings are constructed by these students and reflects upon interpretation and meaning construction, according to new epistemological perspectives that have been postulated recently (Morin 1998; Lankshear & Knobel 2003). It, thus, considers the present needs of the multimodal and hypertextual communication approached in the multiliteracy studies (Cope & Kalantzis 2000), and the university preparation for a critical and participative cultural and social practice (Castels 1999).

Improved passage 1:
The research analysis focuses on Brazilian university students and their reading of cinema images. It explores how these students construct meanings from the images and reflects on interpretation and meaning construction based on new epistemological perspectives. The article takes into account the current requirements of multimodal and hypertextual communication in multiliteracy studies and the importance of university education in preparing students for critical and participative cultural and social practices. The references to Morin (1998), Lankshear & Knobel (2003), Cope & Kalantzis (2000), and Castels (1999) suggest that the analysis draws on these scholars' work to inform its findings and conclusions.

Passage 2:
This article presents an investigation that is part of a broader exploratory researchi that aims at knowing about the impact of digital language on Brazilian university students. The research is related with interpretation and epistemology, considering that it proposes 1) to investigate students' ability to make meaning in digital environments (Internet and movies) and 2) to observe their knowledge construction in these environments. For such intent, a series of qualitative investigations, of ethnographic characteristic, has been designed for accomplishing systematic research of university classroom practices that could show traces  to the researcher (and to her group of researchers) about Brazilian university students’ learnings and familiarity with critical literacy, according to the new literacies and multiliteracies theories. The researcher of this investigation is also the article's author who expects that the article may generate discussions towards the adequacy or the necessary changes in university curriculum, considering that this research outcome complements the analysis of two other related investigations that have already been publishedii 

Improved passage 2:
The article presents an investigation that is part of a broader research project aiming to understand the impact of digital language on Brazilian university students. The research focuses on interpretation and epistemology, specifically investigating students' ability to make meaning in digital environments and observing their knowledge construction in these environments.

The research utilizes qualitative investigations with an ethnographic approach to systematically study university classroom practices. The goal is to identify traces of students' learnings and familiarity with critical literacy, based on theories of new literacies and multiliteracies.

The researcher, who is also the author of the article, hopes that the findings will contribute to discussions about the adequacy or necessary changes in the university curriculum. This research complements two other related investigations that have already been published.

Overall, the article presents a research project that aims to understand how digital language impacts Brazilian university students and how their knowledge is constructed in digital environments. The findings are expected to inform discussions about the university curriculum.

Passage 3:
The investigation presented in this paper follows an exploratory and qualitative research orientation, in accordance with research methodologies described by André (1995), a Brazilian methodologist that emphasizes the need of the ethnographic perspective in the analysis of local studies about environments, participants and cultures. It is an exploratory investigation considering that it plans to allow the exploration of data that would not conventionally compose the same research corpus, in the case, chat-room users that would then be categorized within actors of earlier forms of social networking (letter-writing; book clubs; telephoning) and movie viewers that would be in the same category of computer game-players, for instance, in an attempt to know the intertwining of a new assembly of practices and knowledge, epistemologically thinking. The investigation is also qualitative, considering that its analysis represents the researcher’s theoretical reference, values and view of the world, conferring a qualitative dimension to the investigation itself, as claimed by André.

Improved passage 3:
The qualitative approach allows for a deeper understanding of the participants' experiences, perspectives, and behaviors. It focuses on the meanings and interpretations individuals give to their actions and interactions within a specific context. This approach is particularly useful when studying complex social phenomena, such as the emergence of new forms of social networking and the impact of technology on social interactions.

By adopting an ethnographic perspective, the investigation aims to immerse itself in the participants' natural environment and observe their behaviors and interactions in their everyday lives. This approach allows for a more holistic understanding of the social and cultural dynamics at play.

The researcher's theoretical reference, values, and view of the world are acknowledged as influencing the analysis and interpretation of the data. This recognition adds a qualitative dimension to the investigation, as it acknowledges the subjectivity and interpretive nature of the research process.

Overall, this exploratory and qualitative investigation seeks to uncover the complexities and interconnections between different forms of social networking and the practices and knowledge associated with them. It aims to provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the participants' experiences and the broader social and cultural context in which they are situated.

Passage 4:
The investigation required that participants be chat-room users, planning to count on their perceptions about the elements (participants, nicknames, encounters, disruptions, treatments) and play of structures (committed / uncommitted relationships, entertaining / misleading / committed conversation, veiled / unveiled feelings, constructed / deconstructed / reconstructed narratives, plural identities) that build chat-room discourse. Thirty-four university-level students participated in the investigation: aged 21-25 years old, being all of them coincidentally female (it was not a requirement for being part of the investigated group). They were explained that the process consisted of seeing a movie, writing the description of their views on certain aspects of the film, and taking part of a collective interview. The option for the two research tools–the written description and the collective interview–lies in the fact that the former should provide written individual reports of the students’ perspectives about the movie that they would be shown; the latter should clarify  and complement information that could be necessary for data analysis. In the sequence, the participants were shown a movie and then described the aspects to which they were guided. The collective interview sought for more clarifications about some of the written descriptions that showed relevance to the research itself. The choice for adopting these research instruments is due to the concern that new knowledge–such as the one that has been generated by digital language–naturally raises new epistemological studies. In these studies, the research methodologies were expected to show congruence with the theories of the focused knowledge.

Improved passage 4:
The investigation aimed to study chat-room discourse and its various elements and structures. To do this, the researchers recruited participants who were chat-room users. The participants' perceptions about different aspects of chat-room discourse, such as participants, nicknames, encounters, disruptions, and treatments, were considered important for the investigation.

The study involved thirty-four female university-level students aged 21-25 years old. It is worth noting that being female was not a requirement for participation; it just happened that all the participants were coincidentally female. The participants were informed that they would watch a movie and then write a description of their views on certain aspects of the film. They were also told that they would take part in a collective interview.

The researchers chose to use two research tools: a written description and a collective interview. The written description was expected to provide individual reports of the participants' perspectives on the movie. The collective interview was conducted to gather additional information and clarify any relevant points from the written descriptions.

The decision to use these research instruments was influenced by the fact that new knowledge, particularly in the realm of digital language, often requires new epistemological studies. The researchers believed that the chosen research methodologies should align with the theories and concepts related to the focused knowledge in order to ensure congruence and validity in the study.

Passage 5:
It should be noted that the new literacies studies as well as researches on this theme are in a starting phase in Brazil, demanding a wide sort of surveys and researches about a great range of issues related to the topic, differently from other countries that may already count on available research and analysis of their literacy education. It should also be observed that despite using the theoretical reference that is shared by researchers in various other countries, this investigation evidences its social and cultural construction, as one would probably expect. That means, it may show Brazilian characteristics in which participants (university students that are chatroom users) , environments and processes reveal their own social and cultural construction.

Improved passage 5:
This implies that the findings and conclusions drawn from this research may not be directly applicable to other contexts or countries. The social and cultural factors specific to Brazil may influence the way in which participants engage with chatrooms and develop their literacies. Therefore, it is important to consider these unique characteristics when interpreting the results of this study. Additionally, the fact that the new literacies studies are in their early stages in Brazil suggests that there is still much to be explored and understood about this topic in the Brazilian context. Further surveys and research are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issues related to new literacies in Brazil.

Passage 6:
The outcome shown in the present paper focuses on an epistemological concern: understanding the relationship between the network mind and the typographic mind (Castells 1999), considering that the interlocutors’ perception may benefit from the enhancement that is likely to be promoted by their dealing with the internet. Castells makes a difference between the “typographic mind” and the “network mind” produced in different social and historic moments of societies, being the first the one that resembles the typographic-produced text, a result of a linear and conventional education, and the second the result of a non-linear and networklike reasoning and epistemology that is observed in the digital societies. This investigation, therefore, observes whether an “ability” which is developed with the aid of this new medium is transferred to another environment that does not necessarily or apparently require mind networking. This proposal searches for expanding views on “digital epistemologies” (Lankshear & Knobels 2003), under the premise that the stability in the rules of the game as the norm represents conventional  epistemology built on propositional knowledge of what already exists, which sounds inadequate to explain language and discourse in contemporary society, as it is adverted by the cited authors. They assert: Rethinking epistemology in a digital age might involve thinking of it as practices of knowing that reflect a range of strategies for assembling, editing, processing, receiving, sending, and working on information and data to transform diverse resources of ‘digitalia’ into ‘things that work’ (Lankshear & Knobels 2003, p 173).

Improved passage 6:
The main focus of this paper is to explore the relationship between the "network mind" and the "typographic mind" as described by Castells. The typographic mind refers to the traditional linear and conventional education that produces a certain way of thinking, while the network mind is associated with the non-linear and network-like reasoning observed in digital societies.

The paper aims to investigate whether the skills and abilities developed through internet use can be transferred to other environments that may not seem to require network thinking. It seeks to expand the understanding of "digital epistemologies" by challenging the notion that conventional epistemology, based on propositional knowledge of existing information, is sufficient to explain language and discourse in contemporary society.

The authors argue that in a digital age, epistemology should be seen as a practice of knowing that involves various strategies for processing, editing, and transforming information and data. They emphasize the importance of understanding how individuals assemble, receive, send, and work on digital resources to create functional outcomes.

Overall, the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of how the internet and digital technologies shape our thinking and epistemological practices in contemporary society.

Passage 7:
With such concern in mind, this investigation is interested in describing university-level students’ meaning making in terms of a ‘performance epistemology’, when the investigated are both chat-room users and movie viewers, verifying the interweaving of experiences between the two media. Lankshear & Knobels (2003) see the notion of ‘performance epistemology’ as central in an increasingly intensely digitized world considering that it is related with knowing how to proceed in the absence of existing models and exemplars (p. 173), or knowing how to proceed in a quest for new meanings, a practice that may permit breaking rules and innovating. Besides the cited authors, this preoccupation about a renovated epistemology is shared by several other researchers, as seen in Cope and Kalantzis’s acknowledgement of the inadequacy of conventional knowledge for the practices and needs of a digital society: The role of pedagogy is to develop an epistemology of pluralism that provides access without people having to erase or leave behind different subjectivities. This has to be the basis of a new norm (2000, p. 18). The authors acknowledge that a new view of society is emerging, that a view of mind, meaning, and society converge on a language of awareness of the socioculturally and sociohistorically workings that go beyond fixed patterns or standardizations and adopt plural values and perspectives.

Improved passage 7:
In this investigation, the focus is on university-level students and their meaning-making processes in relation to a "performance epistemology." This concept, as described by Lankshear and Knobels (2003), is particularly relevant in a highly digitized world where individuals must navigate without established models or examples. It involves knowing how to proceed in the search for new meanings, which may involve breaking rules and innovating.

The concern for a renewed epistemology is not limited to Lankshear and Knobels. Other researchers, such as Cope and Kalantzis, also recognize the inadequacy of traditional knowledge in the context of a digital society. They argue that pedagogy should aim to develop an epistemology of pluralism that allows for the inclusion of diverse subjectivities without erasing or leaving them behind. This new perspective acknowledges the emergence of a society where mind, meaning, and society are understood through an awareness of sociocultural and sociohistorical dynamics that go beyond fixed patterns or standardizations. Instead, it embraces multiple values and perspectives.

Overall, this investigation seeks to explore how university students engage in meaning-making processes within chat rooms and through watching movies, and how these experiences intersect. It aims to understand how these students navigate a digitized world and develop new meanings, potentially challenging established norms and practices.

Passage 8:
The idea of pluralism is brought to the interpretation of data in this article, under the premise that the new literacies studies allow and expect that knowledges that have conventionally and paradigmatically belonged to their proper and specific areas may now have a dialogical treatment in the analyses weaving. The theoretical frame in this article comes from critical literacy and digital epistemologies, both in the new literacies or multiliteracies studies, besides critical hermeneutics, in an attempt to go beyond a possible cultural imprinting that patterns or models the structures of people’s cultural and social reading of their environments, as Morin (1998) critiques when alluding to conventional  epistemologies. To this author, culture is imprinted when education provides each person with principles, rules and instruments of knowledge through language. Therefore, culture works on the spirit and mind modeling their cognitive structures that co-produce knowledge. Understanding how culture and knowledge are constructed in the technologically influenced language of the digital societies gains relevance in the new literacies and multiliteracies studies, then.

Improved passage 8:
The article argues that the concept of pluralism should be applied to the interpretation of data, particularly in the context of new literacies studies. It suggests that knowledge that was traditionally confined to specific areas can now be analyzed and discussed in a more interactive and dialogical manner. The theoretical framework of the article draws from critical literacy, digital epistemologies, and critical hermeneutics. It aims to move beyond cultural imprinting, which refers to the tendency for cultural and social structures to shape people's understanding of their environment. The author suggests that education plays a role in imprinting culture by providing individuals with principles, rules, and tools of knowledge through language. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding how culture and knowledge are constructed in the language of digital societies, as influenced by technology. This understanding is seen as crucial in the field of new literacies and multiliteracies studies.
